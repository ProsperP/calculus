I haven't done calculus in decades. Well, that's no longer true because I
recently took a single-variable calculus course. The 13-week online class was
taught by Robert Ghrist. He's the calculus teacher you wish you had.

This repo contains some of the ideas that we covered in class and some of the
ideas that occured to me while taking the class.
